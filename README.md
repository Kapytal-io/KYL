# KYL
Repository for the development, documentation, and debugging of Kapytal Exchange Token (KYL coin).
## Overview
The token created on this repo make used the protocol 20, that is a standar of Open Zeppelin to built a contract on Solidity to manage tokens on Ethereum Net. Also in the same repo there are some contracts that define the crowdsale for the next pre ICO and ICO by [Kapytal](http://kapytal.io)

The contracts of crowdsale does not follow any standar, but it try to be congruent of many others process of crowdsale.

## Technologies used

The contracts were created on solidity version 0.4.22 that is a stably version sugered for Open Zeppelin for develop token proyect, to facility be checked for some others and be rigth to the standar.

Also implement some archives in JavaScript to preconfigure the crowdsale deploy contract, be necesary for manage the acount that goint to receive the capital coin in the process.

## Requirements

There are to types requirements, in the case when we only prove the contracts as localhost or when we whant to deploy at mainnet or testnet. In both cases, we previously need to install any of the next browsers like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/es-MX/firefox/new/),[Chrome](https://www.google.com.mx/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwtIXbBRBhEiwAWV-5ntiyem_D4XVkYgG1mjIpJiBvjTsPj4I6qvQOGhimI_dQ-qONkuFCfBoC3BUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CLD63bvxzNwCFYnbwAodETIJmA), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/es) or [Brave](https://brave.com) and that why we also need [Metamask](https://metamask.io) for run the proves.
